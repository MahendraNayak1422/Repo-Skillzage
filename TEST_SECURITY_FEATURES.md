# Test Security Features Documentation

## Overview
This document describes the comprehensive test security system implemented for the quiz/exam functionality in the Skillzage platform. The security features ensure academic integrity by preventing cheating during online examinations.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Full Screen Mode (Automatic)
- **Purpose**: Prevents students from accessing other applications or browser tabs during the exam
- **Implementation**: 
  - Automatically enters full screen mode when exam starts
  - Uses `requestFullscreen()` API with cross-browser compatibility
  - Monitors full screen state and warns users if they attempt to exit
- **User Experience**: 
  - Seamless transition to full screen mode
  - Warning messages if user attempts to exit full screen
  - Automatic re-entry attempt after violations

### 2. Tab Switching Detection
- **Purpose**: Detects when students try to switch to other tabs or applications
- **Implementation**:
  - Uses `visibilitychange` event to detect tab switching
  - Uses `blur` event to detect window focus changes
  - Tracks all violations and provides warnings
- **User Experience**:
  - Immediate warning when tab switching is detected
  - Clear indication of violation count
  - Progressive warnings leading to exam restart

### 3. Auto-Restart After 3 Warnings
- **Purpose**: Automatically restarts the exam if multiple security violations occur
- **Implementation**:
  - Tracks warning count across all security violations
  - Resets exam state completely when maximum warnings reached
  - Clears all answers and progress
- **Features**:
  - Configurable warning limit (default: 3)
  - Complete exam reset including progress and answers
  - Toast notifications for all violations and restart

### 4. Additional Security Measures

#### Keyboard Shortcut Blocking
- Prevents common shortcuts that could be used to cheat:
  - Alt+Tab (task switching)
  - Ctrl+Tab (browser tab switching)
  - F11 (fullscreen toggle)
  - F12, Ctrl+Shift+I (developer tools)
  - Ctrl+R, F5 (refresh)
  - Ctrl+U (view source)
  - Ctrl+S (save)
  - Ctrl+P (print)
  - Ctrl+N (new window)
  - Ctrl+T (new tab)
  - Ctrl+W (close tab)
  - Ctrl+L (address bar focus)

#### Context Menu Disabling
- Right-click context menu is disabled during exam mode
- Prevents access to browser developer tools and other options

#### Text Selection Blocking
- Disables text selection during exam mode
- Prevents copying of questions or other content

## File Structure

### Core Components

1. **TestSecurity.tsx** - Main security wrapper component
   - Handles all security event listeners
   - Manages full screen mode
   - Tracks violations and warnings
   - Provides security status UI

2. **QuizTaker.tsx** - Enhanced quiz component
   - Integrates with TestSecurity component
   - Shows security confirmation screen
   - Tracks security violations in quiz results
   - Manages exam state and restart functionality

3. **QuizManager.tsx** - Admin interface for quiz creation
   - Security features toggle option
   - Configuration UI for security settings
   - Documentation of security features for administrators

## Usage

### For Administrators
1. Create a quiz through the Quiz Manager interface
2. Enable "Secure Exam Mode" toggle when creating the quiz
3. Configure quiz settings (passing score, questions, etc.)
4. Students will automatically see security confirmation before starting

### For Students
1. Navigate to quiz and click "Take Quiz"
2. Review security confirmation screen explaining the restrictions
3. Click "Start Secure Exam" to begin
4. Complete quiz in full screen mode without switching tabs or applications
5. Security violations are tracked and displayed

### Security Status Display
- Red status bar at top of screen during exam mode
- Live warning counter (e.g., "Warnings: 1/3")
- Remaining warnings indicator
- Clear visual feedback for all security states

## Technical Implementation

### Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers supporting Fullscreen API
- Cross-browser event handling for visibility changes
- Fallback handling for unsupported features

### Data Tracking
- Security violations are stored with quiz attempt data
- Warning count persisted in student progress records
- Audit trail for security incidents

### Event Handling
- Comprehensive event listener management
- Proper cleanup on component unmount
- Prevention of event propagation for blocked actions

## Security Considerations

### What This Prevents
✅ Tab switching  
✅ Alt+Tab application switching  
✅ Browser developer tools access  
✅ Copy/paste operations  
✅ Right-click context menu  
✅ Browser refresh/navigation  
✅ Fullscreen exit attempts  
✅ Common keyboard shortcuts  

### Limitations
❌ Cannot prevent external camera/phone recording  
❌ Cannot prevent second monitor usage  
❌ Cannot prevent network-based collaboration  
❌ Cannot prevent physical notes/materials  
❌ Limited effectiveness on mobile devices  

### Best Practices
1. Combine with other proctoring methods for high-stakes exams
2. Use randomized question pools
3. Implement time limits
4. Consider question shuffling
5. Use clear academic integrity policies

## Configuration Options

### Quiz Creation
```typescript
interface QuizForm {
  title: string;
  passing_score: number;
  enable_security_features: boolean; // Toggle for security mode
}
```

### Security Settings
```typescript
interface TestSecurityProps {
  isExamMode: boolean;        // Enable/disable security mode
  onWarning: () => void;      // Warning callback
  onAutoRestart: () => void;  // Restart callback
  warningCount: number;       // Current warning count
  maxWarnings: number;        // Maximum allowed warnings (default: 3)
}
```

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Camera Monitoring**: Integration with webcam access for visual proctoring
2. **Screen Recording**: Detection of screen recording software
3. **Network Monitoring**: Detection of network activity during exam
4. **Mobile Optimization**: Enhanced security for mobile devices
5. **Biometric Verification**: Fingerprint or face recognition
6. **AI Monitoring**: Machine learning-based suspicious behavior detection
7. **Session Recording**: Complete session recording for review
8. **Advanced Analytics**: Detailed security violation analytics and reporting

### Integration Options
- Learning Management System (LMS) integration
- Third-party proctoring service integration
- Single Sign-On (SSO) with academic institutions
- Grade book synchronization

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Fullscreen Not Working**: Check browser permissions and settings
2. **False Positives**: Adjust sensitivity of detection mechanisms
3. **Mobile Compatibility**: Implement mobile-specific security measures
4. **Browser Compatibility**: Test across different browsers and versions

### Support Considerations
- Clear documentation for students about security requirements
- Technical support procedures for security-related issues
- Backup examination procedures for technical failures

## Conclusion

The implemented security features provide a robust foundation for maintaining academic integrity during online examinations. While no system is completely foolproof, these measures significantly increase the difficulty of cheating and provide audit trails for investigation of suspicious activity.

The system is designed to be user-friendly for honest students while creating substantial barriers for those attempting to compromise the examination process.

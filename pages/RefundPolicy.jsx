        <p>
          At Skillzage, we take pride in the services delivered by us and guarantee your satisfaction with our services and support. We constantly improve and strive to deliver the best accounting, financial or secretarial services through the internet. However, in case you are not satisfied with our services, please contact us immediately and we will correct the situation, provide a refund or offer credit that can be used for future Skillzage orders.
        </p>

        <h3>Not Satisfied? Let us know!</h3>
        <p>
          If you're not satisfied with the service, please send an email to <a href="mailto:services@skillzage.com">services@skillzage.com</a> using the email address from which registration and payment was made. In case you forgot the password, use the forgot password option to reset the password.
        </p>
        <p>
          Provide the details on the services and subscriptions which are not up to your expectations. We will escalate the engagement to the concerned Agent and Managers to speed up the process. Kindly bear with our team as we try our best to complete your engagement to the best of our ability.
        </p>

        <h3>15 Day Refund Policy</h3>
        <p>
          If an engagement is not progressing as per your expectations, you can request for a refund within 15 days of payment. After 15 days, you can request for the refund to be processed as a service credit – which can be used for any other future service.
        </p>
      
              <h3>Earned Fee & Cancellation Fee Deduction</h3>
        <p>
          Before processing any refund, we reserve the right to make a best effort to complete the service. In case you are not satisfied with the service, a cancellation fee of 20% + earned fee + fee paid to the government would be applicable. In case of change of service, the cancellation fee would not be applicable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hence, all refunds will be subject to a minimum of 20% cancellation fee. Further, if Skillzage has spent the time and resources, a fee will be deducted on best judgement basis by the company and the balance will be refunded. Under any circumstance, Skillzage shall be liable to refund only up to 80% of the fee paid by the customer.
        </p>

        <h3>Change of Service</h3>
        <p>
          If you want to change the service you ordered for a different one, you can request this change of service within 60 days of purchase. The purchase price of the original service, less any earned fee and expenses to other third parties will be deducted and the next service will be launched. In case of change of service, there will be no 20% deduction.
        </p>

        <h3>Request Refund</h3>
        <p>
          If you're unsatisfied and want a refund, please initiate the request within 60 days of your purchase. Write to us at <a href="mailto:services@skillzage.com">services@skillzage.com</a> along with your order details, reason for refund, and payment information. Once reviewed, the refund will be processed within 4–5 weeks.
        </p>
                <h3>Factors Outside our Control</h3>
        <p>
          We cannot guarantee the results or outcome of your course subscriptions. Similarly, Skillzage does not guarantee the results or outcomes of the services rendered by our partners (Grooming service provider companies), who are not employed by Skillzage. Problems like these are beyond our control and are not covered by this guarantee or eligible for refund.
        </p>

        <h3>Force Majeure</h3>
        <p>
          Skillzage shall not be considered in breach of its Satisfaction Guarantee policy or default under any terms of service, and shall not be liable to the Customer for any cessation, interruption, or delay in the performance of its obligations by reason of earthquake, flood, fire, storm, lightning, drought, landslide, hurricane, cyclone, typhoon, tornado, natural disaster, an act of God or the public enemy, epidemic, famine or plague, action of a court or public authority, change in law, explosion, war, terrorism, armed conflict, labour strike, lockout, boycott or similar event beyond our reasonable control, whether foreseen or unforeseen (each a "Force Majeure Event").
